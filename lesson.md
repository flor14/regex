# Regular Expresions

> A **regular expression**, often abbreviated to **regex**, is a method of using a sequence of characters to define a search to match strings. 

* Regular expressions are used in:
    -  **search engines**,
    -  **search and replace** dialogs of word processors and text editors,
    -  in **text processing** utilities and in lexical analysis. 

* Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries, as it has uses in many situations

In _data science_, regular expressions are particularly useful for defining **filters**.
