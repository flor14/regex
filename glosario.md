
### String

A string is any series of characters that are interpreted literally by a script. For example, "hello world" and "LKJH019283" are both examples of strings. 

In most programming languages, the string can be either only letters or be letters and numbers (alphanumeric). Many languages also support a string as numbers only, but often is classified as an integer if it's only numbers.
